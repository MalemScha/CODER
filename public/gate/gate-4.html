			<p class="text-center "><h4 style="color: #2ECC40;">GATE Exam Paper Pattern</h4>
			The GATE examination will be conducted ONLINE using computers .In all the papers, there will be a total of 65 questions carrying 100 marks, out of which 10 questions carrying a total of 15 marks are in General Aptitude (GA).
			In the papers the Engineering Mathematics will carry around 15% of the total marks, the General Aptitude section will carry 15% of the total marks and the remaining percentage of the total marks is devoted to the subject of the paper.
			<br><br><br>
			GATE would contain questions of two different types in various papers: <br>	<br>
			(i) Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) carrying 1 or 2 marks each in all papers and sections. These questions are objective in nature, and each will have a choice of four answers, out of which the candidate has to mark the correct answer(s). <br><br>
			(ii) Numerical Questions carrying 1 or 2 marks each in all papers and sections. Solutions for these are real numbers, answered using the virtual keyboard as no answer choices are provided.

			<p class="text-center "><h4 style="color: #d9534f;">The questions in a paper may be designed to test the following abilities:</h4>
				(i) Recall: These are based on facts, principles, formulae or laws of the discipline of the paper. The candidate is expected to be able to obtain the answer either from his/her memory of the subject or at most from a one-line computation. <br><br>
				(ii) Comprehension: These questions will test the candidateâ€™s understanding of the basics of his/her field, by requiring him/her to draw simple conclusions from fundamental ideas. <br><br>
				(iii) Application: In these questions, the candidate is expected to apply his/her knowledge either through computation or by logical reasoning. <br><br>
				(iv) Analysis and Synthesis: In these questions, the candidate is presented with data, diagrams, images etc. that require analysis before a question can be answered. A Synthesis question might require the candidate to compare two or more pieces of information. Questions in this category could, for example, involve candidates in recognising unstated assumptions, or separating useful information from irrelevant information.</p></div>
